# SpaceShipProcessing

The game is very simple: the user controls the spaceships with the arrow keys and he/she should
try to avoid the falling asteroids. The user cannot move the spaceship out of the screen (border
limits the movement of the ship and if the ship collides with them the border turns red to notify the
user he cannot move further in that direction). The game screen is 400x600 and based on the
screen width we decided to put 3 asteroids on each wave. If the spaceship collides with one of the
asteroids the game is over. On the upper left of the game screen is shown the current level of the
game, for each 10 seconds that the users survive the game level increases by one. The speed of
falling asteroids changes with the level, when the level increases the asteroids start falling faster.
On the upper right of the screen is shown the time since the start of the game in minutes:seconds
format. Before the game starts, a countdown is shown on the screen. In the intro screen the user is
provided with the necessary information on how to play the game.
